# Heat Map - freeCodeCamp 
Visualize Data with a Heat Map - 3rd Data Visualization Project from freeCodeCamp 

In the Data Visualization Certification, I learned to build charts, graphs and maps to present 
different types of data with the D3.js library.

I also learned about JSON and how to work with data online using an API.
